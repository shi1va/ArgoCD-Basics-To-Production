## ⭐ Support the Project  
If this **repository** helps you, give it a ⭐ to show your support and help others discover it! 

Here is a **tightened, cleaner rewrite** that keeps your intent intact, improves flow, and stays aligned with CNCF thinking. I’ve reduced repetition and made the language more direct and authoritative.

This is already **very solid**. Only **small, surgical refinements** are needed now. I’ll first give the **recommended edits**, then explain *why*. Nothing fundamental changes.

## Understanding GitOps

Before introducing Argo CD, it is important to first understand **why something like GitOps was needed in the first place**.

GitOps is **not a tool you install or a product you purchase**. It is an **operating model** for managing applications and infrastructure, grounded in DevOps practices, automation, and Git-centric workflows. It represents both a methodology and a cultural shift in how changes are defined, reviewed, and applied across systems.

Argo CD is **not GitOps itself**, but an implementation that helps organizations **achieve and enforce GitOps at scale**. Without understanding GitOps as an operating model, Argo CD can easily be mistaken for just another deployment tool, rather than a key component in improving GitOps maturity.

---

## Why GitOps Was Needed

### The World Before GitOps

Before modern cloud-native platforms, application delivery did not follow a single, consistent operating model.

While **application code** was typically well managed in Git, the systems required to build, deploy, and run that code were **not governed with the same discipline**.

### How Things Typically Looked

**Application code management:**
Source code lived in Git and followed established practices such as branching strategies, pull requests, reviews, automated tests, and controlled merges.

**Infrastructure management:**
Infrastructure was often defined using tools like Terraform or CloudFormation, but changes were commonly applied manually or through loosely structured pipelines, without the same review and approval rigor applied to application code.

**Configuration management:**
Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, or configuration management scripts were frequently edited directly, applied imperatively, or stored outside consistent, review-driven version control workflows.

---

### Challenges Without a Unified Model

Before GitOps as defined by the CNCF, application delivery and operations suffered from fragmented workflows and inconsistent enforcement. While Git was often used for source code, **runtime state was not continuously governed**, leading to systemic operational issues.

#### 1. No single source of truth

* It was often unclear whether **Git**, the running cluster, or a person’s terminal represented the actual state of the system at any given moment.
* Manual changes, scripts, and ad-hoc fixes were not always captured back in version control, resulting in **multiple competing sources of truth** and low confidence in reproducibility, recovery, or disaster scenarios.

#### 2. Desired state vs current state mismatch

* Even when a desired configuration was defined in Git, there was **no continuous mechanism to verify that the running system still matched it**.
* If someone manually modified a Kubernetes resource, applied a hotfix, or changed settings via a cloud console, **no automated process detected or corrected the drift**, allowing the system to silently diverge from its intended state.

#### 3. Manual and imperative changes

* Even when tools like **kubectl**, **Terraform**, or configuration management systems were executed via CI pipelines, they were frequently used in an **imperative, one-time execution model**.
* Changes relied on static files or scripts that were not consistently governed by **strong Git workflows** such as pull requests, protected branches, and mandatory reviews, making them hard to trace, reproduce, and reliably roll back.

#### 4. Poor auditability and rollback

* When incidents occurred, it was difficult to **identify what changed, who made the change, and when it was applied**, especially across multiple tools and environments.
* Because changes were not always tied to a clear Git commit or pull request, **rollbacks were manual, error-prone, and non-deterministic**, increasing recovery time and operational risk.

#### 5. Environment drift

* Over time, environments such as dev, stage, and prod diverged because **changes were applied inconsistently or at different points in time**.
* Manual hotfixes, environment-specific overrides, and out-of-band changes resulted in **inconsistent runtime behavior**, reducing confidence when promoting changes across environments.

#### 6. Security and access risks

* To apply changes, CI systems and engineers often required **direct credentials to production or critical environments**.
* This increased the **blast radius** of misconfigurations or compromised credentials and made enforcing least-privilege access models difficult in practice.

## What Is GitOps

GitOps is an **operating model** for managing applications and infrastructure.

> **GitOps (CNCF OpenGitOps):**
> GitOps is an operating model where the **desired state** of applications and infrastructure is **declared in Git**, and **automated agents continuously reconcile** the running system to match that state.

This definition is important. GitOps is not just about using Git, pipelines, or automation. Under the **CNCF OpenGitOps specification**, **continuous reconciliation is a required property**, not an optional enhancement.

### Role of CNCF in GitOps

The **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)** formalizes GitOps through the **OpenGitOps project**, which defines a **vendor-neutral, tool-agnostic specification** for GitOps. This ensures a shared and consistent understanding of GitOps across tools, platforms, certifications, and the broader cloud-native ecosystem.

The OpenGitOps specification clarifies:

* What qualifies as GitOps
* Why continuous reconciliation is mandatory
* How GitOps differs from CI-driven or IaC-only workflows

## Benefits of GitOps

GitOps directly addresses the operational challenges that existed before a unified operating model.

1. **Single source of truth**

   * Desired state of applications and infrastructure is defined in Git
   * No ambiguity between Git, the cluster, or manual changes

2. **Continuous drift detection and correction**

   * Manual or out-of-band changes are automatically detected
   * Systems continuously converge back to what is defined in Git

3. **Improved security and access control**

   * CI systems do not require direct access to production environments
   * Access is governed through Git permissions, reviews, and approvals

4. **Predictable and auditable changes**

   * Every change is tied to a commit, pull request, and review
   * Rollbacks are deterministic and performed via Git history

5. **Clear ownership and separation of responsibilities**

   * Application delivery is shared between developers and DevOps
   * Platform teams own environment and deployment configuration
   * Collaboration happens through a shared Git-driven workflow

6. **Operational consistency at scale**

   * Same operating model across teams and environments
   * Manual steps and environment-specific behavior are eliminated

> **Important:** GitOps is not a product and not a tool like Argo CD. It is an operating model. Tools such as Argo CD exist to implement and enforce this model.

> **Important:**
> These benefits come from the GitOps *operating model*, not from any single tool.
> Tools like Argo CD exist to **implement and enforce** this model, especially continuous reconciliation.

## How GitOps Fits Into Real-World Delivery

GitOps defines a **single, consistent operating model** for managing applications and infrastructure using Git as the control plane.

Instead of treating application code, infrastructure, and runtime configuration as separate concerns with different workflows, GitOps applies the **same Git-driven discipline across the entire stack**. All changes are proposed via pull requests, reviewed, versioned, and reconciled automatically.

This model builds directly on workflows engineers already trust from CI/CD.

```
Developer change → Feature branch → Pull request → Validation → Merge
```

GitOps extends this familiar pattern beyond application code to include:

* Runtime configuration such as Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, or Kustomize
* Infrastructure definitions such as Terraform or CloudFormation
* Operational configuration managed declaratively

The critical shift is **not the tools or file formats**, but the enforcement of a **single workflow** and **continuous reconciliation** between Git and the running system.

GitOps exists because managing different parts of the system with **different workflows and levels of rigor does not scale** in modern, distributed environments.

---

## Repository Structure and Ownership in GitOps

In practice, GitOps commonly separates repositories based on **clear ownership boundaries between application development and platform operations**. This separation allows teams to move independently while still adhering to the same Git-driven operating model. While this is a **recommended best practice**, it remains context driven rather than mandatory.

---

### 1. Application Repository (App Repo)

The application repository is responsible for **building and validating the software artifact**. It defines how application source code is compiled or packaged, how tests are executed, and how a **versioned, deployable artifact** is produced. This repository ensures that every code change can be reliably built, tested, and verified before it is considered ready for release.

It typically contains:

* **Application source code**
* **Unit and integration tests**

  * Tests are **defined alongside the application source code** for both compiled and interpreted languages
  * Executed via build or runtime tools: **Maven/Gradle** for compiled languages, and language-specific test runners (for example, pytest, unittest, npm test) for interpreted languages, typically invoked by the CI pipeline
* **Dockerfile** used to build the container image
* **Build and test related scripts or configurations**

  * Supporting scripts and configuration files that orchestrate build and test execution
  * Examples include shell scripts, Makefiles, build configs, or test configuration files used by CI pipelines to run builds, tests, and validations consistently
* CI pipeline definitions:

  * Jenkins (`Jenkinsfile`)
  * GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/*.yml`)
  * GitLab CI (`.gitlab-ci.yml`)
  * AWS CodeBuild specifications (`buildspec.yml`)
  * These define build, test, and validation steps as code

> **Note:** CI pipelines often include execution logic such as security scans (for example SonarQube, Trivy), container build and push steps, image tagging, and quality gates. These steps are part of the **build and validation process** and intentionally live inside the application repository as pipeline logic. They do not represent runtime configuration or desired state and therefore do not belong in the GitOps configuration repository.

**Ownership and responsibility:**
This repository is primarily owned by **application development teams**, who are responsible for feature implementation, code quality, and ensuring the application builds and tests correctly. **DevOps or platform teams** may own or contribute shared CI/CD tooling, pipeline standards, and security guardrails, but they do not own the application logic. The focus of this repository is development velocity, fast feedback, and consistently producing a reliable build artifact.

---

### 2. Application Configuration Repository (App Config Repo)

The configuration repository is responsible for **defining and maintaining the desired operational state of the application across environments**. It captures how the application should run, be configured, and be provisioned in target environments, and serves as the **authoritative source of truth** for GitOps reconciliation. This repository prioritizes environment correctness, stability, security, and consistency over application logic.

It typically contains:

* **Kubernetes** manifests
* **Helm** charts
* **Kustomize** bases and overlays for environment-specific configuration
* Infrastructure definitions such as **Terraform** or **CloudFormation**
* **Configuration management definitions** such as **Ansible** playbooks, **Chef** recipes, or **Puppet** manifests, expressed declaratively to describe intended system state

**Ownership and responsibility:**
This repository is primarily owned by **DevOps or platform teams**, who are responsible for environment stability, security, compliance, and consistency across environments. Application developers may propose changes via pull requests, especially for application-specific configuration, but they do not directly manage or mutate live environments. All operational changes are reviewed in Git and applied through automation rather than manual access.

## Application Code Pipeline vs Application Configuration Pipeline

The diagram shows two parallel pipelines that together form a **true GitOps delivery model**:

* **Application Code Pipeline**: produces immutable artifacts
* **Application Configuration Pipeline**: declares and enforces desired runtime state

Both pipelines use Git, branches, and pull requests, but they serve **fundamentally different purposes**.

In GitOps:

* Build systems **never push changes into environments**
* Git **declares desired state**
* Controllers **pull from Git and reconcile continuously**

This separation is intentional and foundational.

---

## Application Code Pipeline (Application Repository)

This pipeline is responsible for **build-time concerns only**.
Its output is a **versioned, immutable artifact**, not a running deployment.

---

**1. Developer Change**

* Application code, tests, dependencies, or build logic are modified on a developer workstation or controlled jump host and committed to Git.
* Changes define *what the application does* and always enter the system through Git, never through direct interaction with environments.

**2. Feature Branch**

* Changes are isolated in short-lived feature branches, used in both GitFlow and trunk-based development models.
* Pull requests to `main` or environment branches (`dev`, `stage`, `prod`) originate from feature branches and are **eligible to merge only after CI validation succeeds**.


**3. CI Pipeline (Build + Test)**

* A pull request automatically triggers CI tools such as Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI to validate the change.
* CI orchestrates builds, tests, code quality checks, security scans (SAST/DAST), SBOM generation, and image scanning, producing an immutable artifact on success.


**4. Merge to Main or Environment Branch**

* The merge is PR-based and protected, occurring **only after CI completes successfully** and required reviews are approved for `dev`, `stage`, or `prod`.
* A successful merge signals that the artifact is approved and trusted, but **no deployment occurs at this stage**.


**5. Publish Artifact**

* The immutable artifact is pushed to an image or artifact registry such as Docker Hub, Amazon ECR, GCR, or ACR.
* This step only publishes the artifact; **no cluster, environment, or runtime system is modified**.

At this point, the **application pipeline is complete**.
The artifact exists, but it is **not yet running anywhere**.

---

**The Handoff (Critical GitOps Boundary)**

After publishing the artifact, CI acts **again**, not as a deployer, but as a **Git user**:

* CI updates the application configuration repository with the new image reference (Kubernetes manifest, Helm values, or Kustomize overlay) via a pull request targeting `dev`, `stage`, or `prod`.
* Merging this pull request represents **deployment intent**, which is later enforced through pull-based reconciliation by a GitOps controller.

This is where **build ends**, **Git declares desired state**, and **GitOps begins**.

---

## Application Configuration Pipeline (Application Configuration Repository)

This pipeline is responsible for **runtime and environment concerns**.
It defines **how and where an approved artifact runs** and ensures the live environment continuously reflects what is declared in Git.

This pipeline **begins where the application pipeline ends**.

---

**1. Developer / DevOps Change**

* Changes enter this repository in two ways:
  * **Developer-driven pull requests**, where application code changes trigger CI to build a new artifact and **propose an updated image version** via an automated PR.
  * **DevOps-driven pushes** for pipeline or cluster-specific updates (for example CI config, labels, resource requests/limits), which **never modify application image versions**.


* In all cases, this repository contains **configuration only**. It defines *how an approved artifact runs* (image reference, replicas, resources, networking, policies) and **never contains application source code**.


**2. Feature Branch**

* Configuration changes are made in short-lived feature branches to isolate impact and enable safe experimentation.
* Pull requests trigger **automated validation**, often deploying the manifests to an **ephemeral test environment** where runtime checks, policy validation, and smoke tests are executed before review and approval.

This ensures configuration changes are **validated in a real cluster context** before they are eligible to merge.

**3. No Build (Declarative Configuration Only)**

* There is no compilation, packaging, or artifact creation in this pipeline.
* Validation may deploy manifests to **temporary environments for testing**, but these environments are **ephemeral and torn down** after validation completes.

The repository still produces **only declarative configuration**, not binaries or images.
Testing does not change the fact that **no artifacts are built here**.

**4. Merge to Main or Environment Branch**

* A merge represents an **approved and validated desired state** for a specific environment (`dev`, `stage`, or `prod`).
* This commit is the explicit and auditable signal of **deployment intent**, which will later be enforced through pull-based reconciliation by a GitOps controller.

At this point, testing is complete, reviews are done, and Git becomes the **authoritative declaration of intent**.



**5. Reconcile (GitOps Controller)**

* A GitOps controller such as **Argo CD or Flux** continuously **pulls desired state from Git** and compares it with the live cluster state.
* Notice the arrow direction in the diagram: **Git → Cluster**.
  There is **no CI system pushing changes** into the cluster. The cluster never accepts deployments directly from pipelines.

This marks a fundamental shift from traditional CI/CD:

* **Push-based model**: CI pipelines authenticate to the cluster and apply changes.
* **Pull-based GitOps model**: the cluster pulls state from Git and reconciles itself.

In GitOps, **CI publishes artifacts and updates Git**.
**Controllers apply state by pulling**, not by being pushed to.


**Continuous Drift Detection and Correction**

* If someone makes a manual or out-of-band change using `kubectl`, a cloud console, or an emergency hotfix, the controller detects the drift.
* The controller automatically **reverts the cluster back to the state declared in Git**, without human intervention.

This closed-loop reconciliation is what distinguishes **true GitOps** from CI-driven or script-based deployments.


**Why GitOps Fits Kubernetes Best**

GitOps is most mature and natural on **Kubernetes** because:

* Kubernetes itself is built around **continuous reconciliation** via controllers.
* GitOps controllers extend this model by reconciling **Git state → cluster state**.
* Drift detection and self-healing are native concepts in Kubernetes.

For **non-Kubernetes targets**:

* Git-based delivery is possible (for example, VMs, cloud resources, PaaS).
* However, **continuous reconciliation is often limited, periodic, or absent**.
* Tools like **Crossplane** help manage infrastructure declaratively, but GitOps-style reconciliation outside Kubernetes is **less mature and less universal**.

In practice:

* **Kubernetes** offers a first-class GitOps experience.
* **Other platforms** can use Git-driven workflows, but they do not always achieve the same level of continuous enforcement.


**Key GitOps Takeaway**

> GitOps is not just “deploying from Git”.
> Application pipelines **publish artifacts**, configuration repositories **declare desired state**, and controllers **pull from Git to continuously reconcile and enforce what is running**.

This explains **why control flows from Git to the cluster**, **why CI does not deploy to environments**, and **why Kubernetes is the natural home of GitOps**.

---

## Deployment Models in Practice

In real-world systems, deployments typically follow one of two models:

* **Push-based deployments**, where CI/CD systems actively deploy changes
* **Pull-based deployments**, where environments reconcile themselves from Git

Both models use Git and automation, but they differ fundamentally in **control flow, responsibility, and runtime enforcement**.

---

## Push-Based Deployment Model (CI/CD-Driven)

In a push-based model, the **CI/CD system is responsible for deploying changes** into target environments.

* **Deployment occurs via CI/CD pipelines**
  After a commit or merge, the pipeline builds the artifact and then directly applies changes to the environment using tools like `kubectl`, Helm, or Terraform.

* **Used when GitOps is not adopted**
  This is the most common and traditional model, especially in Jenkins-centric setups and early Kubernetes adoption phases.

* **Control flow: CI → Environment**
  The pipeline initiates and controls deployments. Once the pipeline finishes, there is no further enforcement unless another pipeline run is triggered.

* **Execution model: event-driven, one-time**
  Deployments happen only when a pipeline runs. If the environment changes afterward, the system does not automatically react.

* **Security model: CI holds environment credentials**
  CI systems require direct access to clusters or cloud accounts, increasing the blast radius if credentials are misused or compromised.

* **Failure and drift recovery**
  If a deployment fails or someone makes a manual change later, recovery requires manual intervention or a pipeline re-run.

This model works, but it tightly couples **build systems with runtime environments** and lacks continuous enforcement.

---

## Pull-Based Deployment Model (GitOps-Driven)

In a pull-based model, the **environment is responsible for applying changes** by continuously reconciling itself with Git.

* **Deployment occurs via a GitOps controller**
  A controller (for example Argo CD or Flux) runs inside or alongside the environment and continuously pulls desired state from Git.

* **Used when GitOps is adopted**
  This model is required to meet the CNCF OpenGitOps definition, as it enables continuous reconciliation.

* **Control flow: Git → Environment**
  Git is the single source of truth. No external system pushes changes into the environment.

* **Execution model: continuous reconciliation**
  The controller constantly compares the live state with Git and converges the system back to the declared configuration.

* **Security model: no external push access**
  CI systems do not need cluster credentials. Access to production is controlled through Git permissions and reviews.

* **Failure and drift recovery**
  Manual or out-of-band changes are automatically detected and reverted, restoring the last known good state from Git.

This model cleanly separates **build-time concerns** from **runtime enforcement** and aligns naturally with Kubernetes’ controller-based architecture.

**Push-Based vs Pull-Based: Summary**

| Aspect               | Push-Based (CI/CD)            | Pull-Based (GitOps)                |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Deployment initiator | CI/CD pipeline                | Environment controller             |
| Control flow         | CI → Environment              | Git → Environment                  |
| Execution style      | Event-driven, one-time        | Continuous reconciliation          |
| Credential exposure  | CI holds environment access   | No external push access            |
| Drift handling       | Manual detection and recovery | Automatic detection and correction |

## Where Argo CD Fits In

So far, we have defined *what* GitOps is and *why* it works.

We now have:

* Git as the **single source of truth**
* CI pipelines that **build artifacts and update Git**
* A pull-based model where **clusters never accept pushed deployments**

What we have **not yet introduced** is the component that actually enforces this model.

This is where **GitOps controllers** come in.

Tools like **Argo CD** and **Flux**:

* Continuously **watch Git for desired state**
* Continuously **compare Git with the live cluster**
* Automatically **reconcile drift**
* Enforce the **Git → Cluster** control flow

Argo CD is **not GitOps itself**.
It is a **controller that implements GitOps principles on Kubernetes**.

In the next lecture, we will:

* Introduce Argo CD’s architecture
* See how it connects Git and Kubernetes
* Understand how reconciliation actually works in practice
